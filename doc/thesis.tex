	\abstract{Single image super-resolution and image denoising are two common tasks in low-level computer vision applications. Single image super-resolution is a classical problem that aims at recovering a high resolution image from a low resolution version of the same image. Image denoising is the process of estimating the clean and original version of an image from a noisy input. In this study we analyse the behaviour of two well-known methods for single image super-resolution and denoising, namely SRCNN [TODO reference] and IRCNN [TODO reference], applied in different order to noisy, low resolution inputs in order to evaluate their combined capability to super-resolve low resolution images with presence of Gaussian noise, Poisson noise and salt-and-pepper noise. As a result we conclude that [TODO] }
