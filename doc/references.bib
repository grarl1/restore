@inproceedings{XAVIER,
	abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

@misc{ADAM,
	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},
