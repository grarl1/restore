\subsection{Deep Learning for Single Image Super-Resolution}
Recently, deep learning methods for \gls{sisr} have demonstrated promising performance and accuracy compared to conventional \gls{sisr} algorithms. Before \gls{srcnn} \cite{SRCNN} was presented, which is the pioneer work in the field, \cite{SISRBENCH}
